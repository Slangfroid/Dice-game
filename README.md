# Dice-game
This is a program for a dice game with these rules:
The game is played with five dice.
The player is asked, "Roll dice?" at the beginning of each turn.
If the player answers "n" or no, the game is over.
If the player answers "y" or yes, the points are added to their score.
The player scores 100 points for each one that is rolled.
The player scores 50 points for each five that is rolled.
The dice values and player score are displayed on the screen.
If the player does not roll any ones or fives the game is over. 
UPDATE >> If the player does not roll any ones of fives their score is set back to 0 and their turn ends.

It contains 3 seperate defined functions (main(), roll_dice(),get score()), one import function(random), and 2 classes (Max_sided_di, number_of_dice).
Required software: Anything that can run python.
